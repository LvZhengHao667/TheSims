# TheSims
This is a Sims-like game where each day you can travel to different locations to earn money, with the ultimate goal of saving up one million dollars. The game also features a variety of mini-games, ready for you to discover.In this program, we have not only met all the scoring criteria but also implemented many additional features, such as sorting functions, text color changes, the use of ArrayLists, and more. This is a comprehensive and well-rounded group project.We did not use any AI,and this was entirely developed independently, relying solely on what was taught in class and our own self-study.
